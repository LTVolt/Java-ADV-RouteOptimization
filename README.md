# Java-ADV-RouteOptimization

Route Optimization project using DSA (Ver 1.0)

In this project we have a set of locations (A - H), how they connect to each other and what distance each Node has to any of its connections.

When running, the user is prompted to type in their starter location, and their destination location.
Then, the program calculates the shortest distance between those points and shows the user the optimal directions, as well as the total distance to travel.

There is a helper Map Image in \RouteOpti\src\extras.

**Note**: Even though the Map only shows arrows being one-way, all connections are both ways (I just got lazy after changing it to 2-way).

Useful applications would be something like creating optimal routes in a GPS app, especially if the user needs more than 1 stop.
